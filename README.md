Dry Answers:

1. The class that is used to implement the controller pattern in this library is SnappingSheetController.
The features it allows the developer to control are the sheet itself and the snapping position of the widget.

2. The parameter that controls this behavior is snappingCurve.

3. One advantage of InkWell over GestureDetector:
InkWell provides an ink splash to a tap, and if we want that specific reaction,
then InkWell is already good for us and ready to use without much effort.
One advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell:
GestureDetector is more general than InkWell and it enables more control over the gesture we detect.
For example, it can take care of dragging gesture and do something in response.
